KIT Iteration Log
- Targeted REQ-IDs: REQ-007 (next open scope per PLAN; needed reporting endpoints built atop prior campaigns/contacts/calling data)
- Scope: Added reporting service, FastAPI router, schemas, CSV streaming, and tests/doc/LTC/HOWTO; out-of-scope items include dashboard frontend or async export jobs.
- Tests: `pytest -q runs/kit/REQ-007/test`
- Prerequisites: Python 3.12, virtualenv, deps from `runs/kit/REQ-007/requirements.txt`
- Dependencies & mocks: SQLite in-memory DB + FastAPI dependency overrides for auth/RBAC; external providers not invoked.
- Product Owner Notes: CSV currently synchronous; extend to async jobs if contact volume grows.
- RAG citations: PLAN.md (reporting scope), SPEC reporting requirements, plan.json lane info.

# PLAN — voicesurveyagent

## Plan Snapshot

- **Counts:** total=24 / open=22 / in_progress=2 / done=0 / deferred=0
- **Progress:** 0% complete
- **Checklist:**
  - [x] SPEC aligned
  - [x] Prior REQ reconciled
  - [x] Dependencies mapped
  - [x] KIT-readiness per REQ confirmed

## Tracks & Scope Boundaries

- **Tracks:**
  - `App` — Core application logic: authentication, campaign management, contact handling, call orchestration, dialogue, events, email, dashboard
  - `Infra` — Database migrations, Redis setup, SQS configuration, EKS deployment, observability stack
  - `Data` — Schema migrations, seed data, retention jobs

- **Out of scope / Deferred:**
  - Inbound call flows, IVR menus, call transfers
  - Multi-tenant isolation
  - Advanced analytics beyond basic metrics
  - Multiple concurrent telephony providers
  - More than 3 survey questions
  - Sentiment analysis or topic modeling

## Notes

### Assumptions
- Single telephony provider (Twilio-compatible) for slice-1
- LLM provider supports streaming for low-latency responses
- OIDC IdP is pre-configured and accessible
- AWS infrastructure (EKS, RDS, SQS) is provisioned separately
- Email service (SES or SMTP) is available

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Telephony provider latency exceeds 1.5s P95
  - **Mitigation**: Implement provider timeout handling, monitor latency metrics, prepare adapter swap
- **Risk**: LLM response quality varies for consent detection
  - **Mitigation**: Use structured prompts, implement fallback detection logic, log edge cases
- **Risk**: CSV upload with large files causes timeouts
  - **Mitigation**: Implement chunked processing, async job for large files
- **Risk**: Concurrent call limits exceeded
  - **Mitigation**: Redis-based distributed locking, rate limiting in scheduler

### Open Questions
- Exact OIDC IdP configuration and claims structure
- Telephony provider selection (Twilio vs alternatives)
- LLM model selection for production (GPT-4 vs Claude)
- Recording storage location and access patterns
